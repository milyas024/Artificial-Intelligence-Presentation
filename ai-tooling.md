# AI Tooling Documentation

In accordance with Quantic requirements, we utilized AI tools to accelerate development:

1. **Google Gemini:** Used for generating the initial 15 synthetic policy documents based on standard financial institution guidelines.
2. **ChatGPT (GPT-4o):** Assisted in debugging the Streamlit UI and refining the keyword matching logic for better citation accuracy.
3. **Cursor/VS Code AI:** Used for boilerplate code generation and setting up the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

The use of AI allowed us to focus on the evaluation and groundedness of the system rather than basic UI coding.
